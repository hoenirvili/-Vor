The rest of the analysis is still valid and hopefully useful to you, just know there’s actually more that needs to be done, don’t try to use that code for a mission critical application out of the box.

                                        React is probably one of the best choices for building UI. Good design, support and community.
                                        React was built to solve one problem: building large applications with data that changes over time. To simplify the process of building complex UIs.

React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. Jordan deserves all the credit for creating React. He was influenced by <b>XHP</b>, <b>a PHP</b>-based component system that is still in use at Facebook, but also by functional programming ideas.
                                        Pete Hunt wanted to use React at Instagram, so he helped to extract React from Facebook-specific code. This prepared React to be open sourced.
                                        Later, Facebook put a team of engineers behind React and also received great contributions from the open source community. Significant contributors include Sebastian Markbåge and Ben Alpert, among many others. Source
